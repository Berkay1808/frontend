# Quattro - KPN App

The Quattro - KPN App is an application designed to track KPN's carbon footprint based on employee travel behavior. Using modern web technologies, such as Vite, Lit Elements, Material Design, and NPM, we developed an efficient and user-friendly app to measure and improve this important aspect of sustainability.

## Installation

## Features.

- **User-friendliness**: The app is designed with an intuitive user interface so employees can easily track their travel information.

- **CO2 logging**: Employees can enter their trips and the app automatically calculates the corresponding CO2 emissions based on different modes of transportation.

- **Graphs and statistics**: Administrators can access graphs and statistics to track and analyze our carbon footprint over time.

- **Sustainability Targets**: The app can set sustainability goals and encourage employees to choose environmentally friendly modes of transportation.
